0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Monday chided the United Nations as “sad,” just days after the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements despite pressure by the U.S. president-elect for a veto by Washington. “The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. ",1
1,"America is falling in love with Melania Trump. You can t help but notice how Melania lights up every time she is around children. Her trip to a local hospital in Rome was no exception. Melania used her special gift of speaking fluently in 5 languages to speak in Italian to the young patients. Melania shined around the sick children and they responded with smiles. Melania s visit with sick children at the hospital in Rome was captured in this AP video:While the media was busy obsessing over her veil and celebrities ignorantly mocked her modest clothing choice during a trip to the Vatican, the First Lady was busy praying over sick children   and it seems at least one of her prayers may have been answered.In fact, mere hours after Mrs. Trump prayed over a little boy whose heart was failing, doctors told her they had found a donated heart that could end up saving his life. But you won t hear that on your nightly news.After she and her husband, President Donald Trump, visited the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis this week, it came out in the news that Mrs. Trump is, in fact, a practicing Catholic.In their travels to the Holy See, Mrs. Trump also visited a Bambin Ges  Hospital, a Vatican-supported hospital in Rome. There, Melania met with many of the pediatric ward s sick children, taking pictures with them and reading them books before spending some time praying at the hospital chapel, the Daily Mail reported. If that wasn t awesome enough, Mrs. Trump, who s fluent in five languages, also reportedly spoke to the children in their native Italian.The article added she left heartfelt, handwritten messages for the children before she left.But something else very special happened at that hospital   the First Lady also reportedly prayed by the bedside of a little Greek boy who s been waiting on a heart transplant.On Wednesday, just hours after spending time together, FLOTUS tweeted from her official account that she d been told doctors had identified a donor heart for the little boy.  MRCTVA little boy who I visited today & had been waiting for a heart transplant will be receiving one! #Blessings #Faith pic.twitter.com/DZU3ojxXVC  Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 24, 2017Melania thanked the doctors and staff for the amazing job they do at the Vatican-supported Bambin Ges  Hospital and asked her 7.2 million followers on Twitter to pray for the patients: Thank you @bambinogesu for the heroic work you do. I ask that everyone keep these amazing children in your thoughts & prayers. pic.twitter.com/UfVAc9lXv2  Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 24, 2017The United States is blessed to have a first lady who doesn t just use the church as a backdrop for a photo-op.

2,"BERNE (Reuters) - Neutral Switzerland is prepared to act as a mediator to help resolve the North Korea crisis, including by hosting ministerial talks, Swiss President Doris Leuthard said on Monday. Leuthard said Swiss troops were deployed on the demarcation zone between South Korea and North Korea and noted that her country - along with Sweden - had a long history of neutral and discreet diplomacy. This has included Switzerland representing U.S. interests in both Iran and Cuba.  But China and the United States had to take their share of responsibility, she added, warning against  over-reactions  after the North s sixth and largest nuclear test. Sanctions  did not change many things  in terms of convincing Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs, even though its population had suffered, Leuthard said.  I think it really is time for dialogue,  she told a news conference in Berne.  We are ready to offer our role for good services as a mediator. I think in the upcoming weeks a lot will depend on how the U.S. and China can have an influence in this crisis. That s why I think Switzerland and Sweden can have a role behind the curtain.  Part of the task would be to find a suitable location for officials   perhaps the countries  foreign ministers   to meet, she said.  I think that s our role, to look at what kind of possibilities we find. Because, well, Twitter won t be an adequate instrument... This must be very discreet.  Noting that the Communist Party congress in North Korea s neighbor and ally China was due to take place in October,  Leuthard said the time for such initiatives was not ideal, so  perhaps this was also part of the plan of North Korea.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un spent part of his youth in Berne studying under an assumed name. A framework agreement between North Korea and the United States, under the Clinton administration, was clinched in 1994 in Geneva after long negotiations. The deal by which Pyongyang was to freeze construction of its nuclear reactors, suspected of being part of its covert weapons program, in exchange for two light water nuclear reactors, unraveled in 2003.  North Korea is a worrying situation. We are a small country. Perhaps they could meet in Switzerland to find a political solution, not one with arms,  Leuthard said. ",1

4,"At the very beginning of May, Trump s Department of Justice issued an opinion that opened the door for all government agencies to withhold information from Congressional Democrats, even if those Democrats are the ranking members of their respective committees. The opinion was written in such a way that Trump and the DOJ can say,  This will apply to regardless of parties,  but that will just be an excuse.It says, in part: Individual members of Congress, including ranking minority members, do not have the authority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation by a full house, committee, or subcommittee. They don t? According to acting Assistant Attorney General Curtis Gannon, they don t. His opinion on the matter went on to say: They may request information from the Executive Branch, which may respond at its discretion, but such requests do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings. Wow. They can t even subpoena certain information unless their committee chair does? This is unprecedented. And it s disgusting.The problem is that the committees are all chaired by Republicans right now. So agencies are required to give info to Republicans, but not to Democrats. The ranking Democrats on Congressional committees will have to get their chairpersons to request information.Because of that, both Republicans and Democrats believe this will prevent Congress from carrying out its duties under the Constitution.Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said that, when he headed the Office of Management and Budget under W., he felt it was his responsibility to provide information to whichever member of Congress asked him for it. However, some of Trump s nominees are refusing to do so even though they re being pressed on that in their confirmation hearings. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) got angry at Trump s nominee for the OMB, who refused to answer that question.Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) said,  This is not what democracy looks like. Trump can t stand opposition. That s part of what makes him so dangerous to this country. He can t stand opposition and he can t stand criticism. He can t stand people doing their jobs correctly when those jobs involve doing things he doesn t like. If Democrats are able to get information just by asking for it, then Trump has less control over what happens to it.Congress is already under sustained fire for how little they work and how much time they spend outside of Washington. And Trump s DOJ just made that even worse. One has to wonder if this is his first step in gaining absolute control over the legislative branch.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",0

6,"21st Century Wire says Over the past month, more than 12 million declassified documents from the CIA have been reportedly published online. While the intelligence docu-dump supposedly sheds additional light on covert war programs, psychic research and the Cold War era, it also contains more evidence confirming the symbiotic relationship between the CIA and American media. In late January the UK s Guardian reported that the CIA themselves released millions of documents online: The CIA has published more than 12 million pages of declassified documents online, making decades of US intelligence files more easily accessible and searchable.The agency published the roughly 930,000 documents that make up the CIA Records Search Tool (Crest) on Tuesday. The online publication of the files was first reported by BuzzFeed News. Although all of the documents in Crest were part of the public record before Tuesday, they could only be inspected by visiting the National Archives in Maryland in person. Once at the archives, just four computers available only during business hours provided access to Crest. A lawsuit from the open-government nonprofit MuckRock prompted the CIA to make the documents available online. Further pressure to publish the documents came from the transparency advocate and journalist Michael Best, who began steadily scanning and uploading the documents one by one. Continuing, the Guardian reported that the CIA also kept files and documents on media organizations and individual reporters. In 2014, Best from MuckRock, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit in order to get the CIA to post all of its documents online. Along the way, Best reportedly crowd-funded more than $15000 to  print out and then publicly upload the records, one by one, to apply pressure to the CIA. Although some mainstream outlets have been somewhat congratulatory of the CIA, many of the files released remain heavily redacted.In the early 1950 s, the CIA ran a wide-scale program called Operation Mockingbird that was said to have infiltrated the American news media in particular, which propagandized the public through various front organizations, magazines and cultural groups.  THE COMPANY    The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States. (Image Source: zerohedge.com)In recent years, there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the Smith-Mundt Act was effectively rendered obsolete by US lawmakers on July 2nd 2013, as published by RT below: Until earlier this month, a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the US Department of State to share domestically the internally-authored news stories sent to American-operated outlets broadcasting around the globe. All of that changed effective July 2, when the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations. The Smith-Mundt Act has ensured for decades that government-made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the US. An amendment tagged onto the National Defense Authorization Act removed that prohibition this year.

Yet even while the Senate Intelligence Committee was holding its hearings in 1976, according to high level CIA sources, the CIA continued to maintain ties with seventy five to ninety journalists of every description executives, reporters, stringers, photographers, columnists, bureau clerks and members of broadcast technical crews. More than half of these had been moved off CIA contracts and payrolls but they were still bound by other secret agreements with the Agency.

9,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - What a difference a year makes. A year ago, Prime Minister Theresa May was pictured standing alone at an EU summit, nervously playing with her sleeve as other leaders embraced and chatted around her - an image that summed up her isolation after Britain voted for Brexit. On Thursday, with the leaders of the other 27 states poised to agree to move Brexit talks forward to the decisive phase of discussing future ties, the 61-year-old was greeted with a show of support, including applause and a round of congratulations during a summit dinner. She needs it: the second phase of talks is likely to be even more difficult than the first and could widen divisions in her government, her party and the country over what Britain should become after Brexit. May also faces an emboldened parliament at home. Rebels in her Conservative Party joined forces with opposition lawmakers to vote against the government on her Brexit blueprint - something they may try to repeat next week when May plans to write Britain s departure date into law. But the change in atmosphere in Brussels improves the chances of a friendlier divorce, reducing the possibility of Britain crashing out without a deal. It may be a change born of necessity. A weakened May could be forced from office and the EU does not want to see a new, possibly hardline negotiator across the table half way through the talks.  She is the best we ve got. She s all we got,  said a senior EU official, comparing her positively with her Brexit minister, David Davis, whose comment that the initial deal was a statement of intent rather than a legal pact annoyed many in the bloc. For many Conservatives too, May is seen as the leading contender for securing Britain s exit in March 2019.  I think the prime minister is certainly far and away best placed to do that,  said British lawmaker and Brexit supporter David Jones, who was moved from his position as a Brexit minister earlier this year.  She s done very well in connection with this first stage of the agreement against the odds ... What she has actually achieved is acceptance on the part of the European Union that not only are we leaving but we can leave without causing a problem to them internally.  ACCIDENT-PRONE May was appointed prime minister shortly after Britain voted 18 months ago to leave the EU and she is committed to honoring that decision and unraveling four decades of EU membership. But the path has not been smooth. After losing her party s majority at a June election, May has been almost unnaturally accident-prone.  An attempt to reassert her authority collapsed in a coughing fit during a speech at a Conservative party conference in October. Last week, a choreographed attempt to seal the deal to move on to the second phase of talks with the EU fell apart after her Northern Irish allies refused to sign off on it. That was when European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker hailed May as  a tough negotiator , one who  is defending the point of view of Britain with all the energy we know she has . An embarrassing defeat in parliament on Wednesday has underlined her weakness in relying on the support of a small Northern Irish party to pass legislation. But after two failed attempts from within her party to oust her, May has proved many detractors wrong, pushing on with Brexit, which has sapped the government s ability to pursue other policies and will define her time in power.  The government s defeat on the amendment will make our exit more complicated, and there is now an incentive for the EU not to negotiate a good deal,  said Conservative lawmaker John Baron.  However, this process was hardly ever going to be smooth, and we remain on course to honor the referendum result.  So for now, she is carrying her divided party with her. But the agreement to move to phase two, which some Conservatives described as a compromise, has shown some fraying at the edges of the coalition. The key is for her to keep her cabinet ministers on board.  It s a fudge to get to the next stage ... but  Leave  cabinet members have been reassured they will get the Brexit they want,  said a senior Conservative source. That may mean keeping the possibility open of Britain moving away from EU regulations after it leaves, which could worry EU officials.   The British people will be in control,  environment minister Michael Gove said last week.  If the British people dislike the arrangement that we have negotiated with the EU, the agreement will allow a future government to diverge.  ",1

11,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia s Shura Council, a top advisory council to the government, is studying proposals for protection of people who report financial crime, local media reported, following the government s anti-corruption crackdown. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has launched an inquiry into graft that has resulted in the detention of a dozens of princes, senior officials and businessmen. The Shura Council does not have legislative powers, but it can propose laws to the king and the cabinet. It said in a tweet on Monday that it had agreed on the  appropriateness of the draft proposal  for whistleblower protection for financial and administrative corruption. The Arabic-language newspaper al-Riyadh reported on Tuesday that the council had agreed to study two proposals on the matter that also included protection of eyewitnesses who report violations such as financial crime. A top official said earlier this month that Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in an anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft.  The Government of Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is working within a clear legal and institutional framework to maintain transparency and integrity in the market,  Attorney General Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said in a statement on Nov. 9. The investigation has spread to the neighboring United Arab Emirates, as the UAE central bank asked commercial banks and finance companies there to provide details of the accounts of 19 Saudis detained in the crackdown. The UAE central bank governor said last week the request by the central bank for local banks and finance companies to provide details of the accounts of 19 Saudi Arabian citizens was just an information-gathering exercise.

12,"This is one Daily Show segment that every Republican should be forced to watch over and over until they learn the true history of their own party.On Thursday night, Trevor Noah tackled the Republican claim that Democrats are the real racists because Lincoln freed the slaves and the KKK backed Democrats for decades after the Civil War.Earlier this week, former Obama adviser Van Jones had a heated argument with right-wing CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord, who defended Donald Trump by claiming that the KKK is a Democratic creation built to  further the progressive agenda. What the f*ck?  Noah responded.  I ve seen this argument on Facebook   in fact, I ve seen it everywhere online.  Did you know that Democrats are the real racist party? And did you know the Republican Party freed the slaves? Noah called Lord s claim  bullshit,  and proceeded to delve into history to demonstrate how the KKK switched their allegiance to the Republican Party. A lot of people like to skip over the fact that, when it comes to race relations, historically, Republicans and Democrats switched positions,  Noah said.  Yeah. Republicans were basically Democrats, and Democrats were basically Republicans. Noah explained that while it s true that the KKK supported Democrats for decades after Lincoln freed and slaves, the white supremacist group switched to a more welcoming Republican Party in the 1960s after Democrats began supporting and enacting policies like the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Presidents Harry S Truman and Lyndon Johnson, both southerners, angered what became known as the Dixiecrats, Southern Democrats who left the Democratic Party starting in 1948 in opposition to the expansion of civil rights.Johnson would predict while signing the Civil Rights Act of 1965 that Democrats just  lost the South for a generation. He was half-right,  Noah said,  because, in fact, the Democrats lost the South for more than a generation. Indeed, the once proud party of Lincoln quickly became a big tent for racists to flock to for shelter and it has not only remained that way ever since, the racists have now seized control of the party entirely.Noah even used  huge racist  former Senator Strom Thurmond as an example of how Southern Democrats turned Republican. Strom Thurmond was among the most racist politicians of his generation, and in the  60s, he switched to being a Republican because he felt more welcome,  Noah said of Thurmond, who started his political career as a Democrat in the 1930s. Just because something used to be something, doesn t mean it still is,  Noah said.  What matters more is what it is now. Like a butterfly used to be a caterpillar   you don t call it a flying caterpillar. Here s the video via Comedy Central:The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveIn short, what matters is that the Republican Party is associated with the KKK and the KKK supports the Republican Party. That s been the case for a few decades now, but it s incredibly obvious today in 2016. And America is now dangerously close to having a President who pals around with the KKK and other white supremacists.Featured image: Houston Chronicle",0
13,"The security of our nation has never been more threatened than it is today, under the incompetent leadership of Barack Hussein Obama. The idea that we have one of the most highly trained group of warriors in our US Military paying for their own combat gear is unconscionable. Meanwhile, we are about the spend $50 MILLION or $42,000 per tortoise, to transplant  them from a desert in CA to a new environment, where they may or may not survive, is a perfect example of how upside down our nation s priorities are today Breitbart   Congressman Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA), a Marine with three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan on his resume, says Navy SEALs have been telling him they are running short on combat rifles.The Associated Press reports Hunter describing a  weapons carousel  in which SEALs returning from deployment hand their weapons off to outgoing troops, a practice he described as undermining the  train like you fight  ideal, and disrupting the personal connection special operators develop with their finely-tuned weapons. Hunter stressed the importance of allowing special operators to train with the same weapons they bring into the field. As it currently stands, following a deployment, a SEAL will have his weapon taken from him, which has been fine-tuned to certain specifications, and given to a different operator to use. This means that SEALs standing by to deploy are waiting for different teams to come back stateside just so they can use their weapons,  said Hunter. They want their rifles. It s their lifeline. So let them keep their guns until they re assigned desk jobs at the Pentagon,  the Congressman urged.According to the Navy Times, some SEALs have been  forced to spend their own money on combat gear. Former active-duty special operator Lt. Cmdr. Sean Matson, visiting Capitol Hill at Hunter s invitation, said he  had to put up $900 of his own money to buy a high-quality ballistic helmet when the Navy dragged its heels on upgrading his kit. Hunter portrayed the SEAL rifle shortage as a consequence of  wasteful spending,  noting that abundant funds for purchasing rifles, which are far less expensive than most of the equipment the military buys, should be available, based on congressional spending authorizations for special ops forces.Hunter s chief of staff Joe Kasper told the Navy Times shortages of  optics, night vision, and laser attachments  have also been reported, even as the budget for Navy Special Warfare increased. So there are obviously some trade-offs being made, but they re occurring at the expense of operators and their firepower   and those are the absolute worst trade-offs to make,  said Kasper. Meanwhile Daily Caller   The Marine Corps is getting ready to conduct a massive operation to move hundreds of desert tortoises living on combat training grounds so they won t be crushed to death by military vehicles.The operation s total cost: $50 million to move 1,185 tortoises, or about $42,000 per tortoise.

16,"Fox host Sean Hannity lost his cool during a radio interview with Ted Cruz yesterday, as the GOP candidate tried to dodge answering questions that might actually be helpful to voters.Hannity, who is a Trump supporter, brought up the way Cruz s campaign handled delegates, stating that it baffled many (and possibly being annoyed that Cruz was more prepared to win over delegates than Trump). Cruz completely avoided answering the question, and actually told Hannity he didn t think people cared about that. Hannity pushed back, insisting that millions of his followers wanted to know because they  find this whole process confusing. Once again, the GOP s least likable Republican dismissed Hannity s question, claiming that the only people who cared were on Trump s team. Cruz must have gotten Hannity s blood boiling, because then the Fox host blew up. He said: Senator, why do you do this? Every single time no, you gotta stop! Every time I have you on the air, and I ask a legitimate question, you try to throw this in my face. I m getting sick of it. I ve had you on more than any other candidate on radio and TV. So if I ask you a legitimate question to explain to the audience, why don t you just answer it? Cruz s response was equally testy as he shot back, Sean, can I answer your last question without being interrupted?  Then he made a half-ass attempt to respond to Hannity s question, but insisted that  as I travel the country, nobody is asking me this, other than the Trumpsters and the people repeating it. Hannity wasn t satisfied and continued to press the Texas Senator, stating that  it s a simple question, it s not a Trump question. You could tell that both men had gotten under each other s skin, because at one point in the interview, Hannity said to Cruz: Senator, I don t know why you re mad. And Cruz insisted that he wasn t mad, he was just annoyed that they were talking  only about the nonsense  instead of policy.Here s the intense interview, via The Sean Hannity Show:The interview clearly left Hannity with a bad taste in his mouth, because when the interview was over he took to Twitter to blast the candidate:TwitterTwitterTwitterHannity is known for giving pretty mild interviews to Republicans, but he was obviously no match for Cruz s ability to annoy anyone he comes in contact with.Featured image via Gerardo Mora / Getty Images",0

19,"The White House is finally wising up and realizing that America s current president is a toddler, and Donald Trump literally cannot be left alone for a moment because he might further incriminate himself or cause another PR disaster.Many people have remarked that while Trump s first overseas trip has been filled with several embarrassing moments and blunders, his activity on Twitter has been uncharacteristically calm. There s a reason for that, and it might become a more permanent thing in the future.According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump s Twitter account may be going under a sort of lockdown that could be implemented long term. This includes a team of lawyers whose sole task is to vet Trump s Twitter activity to make sure he doesn t make himself or his administration look bad. Seriously, how sad is it that a POTUS has so little self control that he needs a team of lawyers to monitor his social media activity?! This is what the WSJ reported:One major change under consideration would vet the president s social media posts through a team of lawyers, who would decide if any needed to be adjusted or curtailed. The idea, said one of Mr. Trump s advisers, is to create a system so that tweets  don t go from the president s mind out to the universe. In its report, the WSJ gave some cringeworthy examples of how Trump s tweets have gone astray, such as the time he accused former president Barack Obama of  wiretapping  him, and the time he implied that his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey were taped.Former campaign aide Barry Bennett doubts that this plan will work, as he said  I would be shocked if he would agree to that  when told about Trump s proposed Twitter surveillance. However, that s not all the lawyers will be sought out for. It s being reported that Trump will also meet with attorneys to  help deal with the legal ramifications of the Russia investigation.  Lord knows Trump needs all the help he can get.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",0
20,"Jayme Liardi makes no secret of the fact that he s isolationistic and xenophobic, and also seems to support, or at least sympathize with, Nazi ideology. That s not hyperbole   he actually does at least appear to be sympathetic to the Nazis, if not an outright supporter.Now he s created a group for young Trump fans and other young xenophobic conspiracy theorists with a name that bears a striking resemblance to the Hitler Youth. It s called the Trump Youth. While they don t mention Trump s name anywhere other than in their own name, the purpose is clear: Donald Trump represents an end to globalism, an end to multiculturalism, and an end to what Liardi clearly sees as the myth of equality.In a video he s made for the Trump Youth, he speaks of the parasites that we must throw off our backs: These parasites, they want war, they want destruction, they want slavery, and they re getting it. And unless we hold them accountable, unless we take justice into our own hands, and throw these parasites off our backs, the world will come to chaos.  [emphasis mine]He goes on to preach fear about the  New World Order,  which is made up of the globalists that are trying to destroy the world. Watch his entire fear-laced spiel below: The Trump Youth are the  hero generation. What does that whole thing sound like? It s not just that Liardi sees globalists as parasites. Nazis considered the Jews to be parasites that fed on society, and were the root of their problems from the end of WWI, into WWII: In this war for the very existence of the German people, we must daily remind ourselves that Jewry unleashed this war against us  As early as 1922 the F hrer said:  We were also those who for the first time made major efforts to explain to the people a danger that had crept up on us, and which millions of people did not recognize, even though it threatened to ruin us all: the danger of the Jews The German people has recognized that the Jew has crept in like a parasite not only into our people, but into all the peoples of the earth, and that it is attempting to corrupt the original racial characteristics of the peoples in order to destroy them both racially and as states, and thereby rule over them.  [emphasis mine]On his own website, Liardi says of WWII: WWII was a turning point in human history. A battle of opposite ideologies. Nationalism vs Globalism, International Communism vs  Nazism Our world today is the world of the victors, the world of the so-called Allies.On one path you have globalism. This is the world of capitalism/communism  The world of blind  equality : All races, cultures and ethnicities are the same, the sexes are the same, each individual is essentially the same. In our sameness, in our equality we are all one homogenous goop, rootless and without an identity, able to be exploited by the tyrants, our alleged representatives that we have in power today. If you have no identity, one will be installed into you by the kosher forces of The State.  [emphasis mine]So there you have it. A blond-haired, fair-skinned young man trying to create a group to fight for the same nationalism for which the Nazis fought. That he calls the group the Trump Youth indicates he may be a white supremacist himself, since it s evocative of the Hitler Youth and since Trump has received endorsements and support from known white supremacists (but don t call them that. They don t like it).Liardi is definitely a racist, a nationalist, and a conspiracy theorist, and he wants to gather other xenophobic racists to bring Trump s ideology to fruition, possibly even if Trump doesn t get electedFeatured image via screen capture from embedded video",0
21," Ever since the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Republicans have insisted on turning the constitutionally-backed nomination process into a political sideshow to deprive Obama of his legal right to name a new Justice and to deprive Americans of their say in the matter.Senate Republicans, led by their Obstructor-in-Chief Mitch McConnell, have repeatedly made the astounding claim that they will refuse to hold nomination hearings for any person Obama may choose. Sight unseen. Instead, they will spend the next 340 days with an empty seat on the Supreme Court   a glowing middle finger neon sign built in the way of the democratic process.For their part, the American people have made it absolutely clear that this sort of political point scoring is inappropriate, offensive, and unwanted. When Fox News (Fox News!) ran a poll asking if Americans supported Obama naming a new justice, an overwhelming majority said yes.Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s recent death has sparked a debate over how to fill the vacancy on the nation s highest court. Taking into consideration that it s an election year, which of the following is closer to your view?It s still the responsibility of current leaders, President Obama and the Senate, to take action to fill the vacancy now: 62The president shouldn t get to nominate someone for a lifetime appointment to the high court this late in his term: 34Note that the number transcends partisan lines. Obama s approval rating sits at around 50 percent. In other words, there are many people that may disagree with the president on issues, but recognize the fact that he is within his rights to name a new Supreme Court Justice.Republicans just don t care.Days after the polls began trickling in saying Americans wanted Obama to be able to fulfill his obligations, McConnell and other Republican leaders held a secret, closed door meeting in his office to decide what to do. Their conclusion was to circle the wagons, dig in and stick their heads in the sand. The Party of No is alive and well.Key Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee emerged from a closed door meeting in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s office Tuesday united in their determination not to consider any nominee to replace Anton Scalia until the next president takes office. We believe the American people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame duck president,  said Majority Whip John Cornryn.This is an egregious  screw you  to not only Democrats and the president, but also to the American people more broadly. It s disgusting that Sen. John Cornryn would invoke the  American people  in his disgusting defense of the GOP s actions, because the American people already had a voice when it came to the process   they voted for President Obama. Twice.If there is any good news in a story that is essentially about one political party destroying the fabric of the democracy to get their way, it s this: Republicans may fold their arms and throw a tantrum, but they are showing everyone   Democratic and Republican voters alike   that they only care about their own self-interest. The voice of the people? They couldn t care less. I wonder how that s going to play on election day.Featured image via Flickr",0

23,"21st Century Wire says You know that western society is approaching its final hour when animal rights activists start advocating individual animals to be able to sue humans in courts. That s exactly what has happened in the US.We can trace some of this line of thinking back to Cass Sunstein, the radical, liberal progressive technocrat and chief advisor to President Barack Obama (as well as the husband of disastrous UN Ambassador Samantha Power). According to his own writing and public declarations, Sunstein believes that activists should be able to bring a lawsuit on behalf of an animal in US courts. In his 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions, Sunstein remarked:Cass Sunstein. My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law. As one of liberal America s most influential technocrats, Sunstein argues that this legal right can be invoked on the basis of animal cruelty. While no cruelty seems to be present in the case of the Monkey Selfie (see story below), activists at PETA were no doubt emboldened by Sunstein and others who have propelled their ideological argument into the political activist discourse.While our society and our legal system are far from perfect, a move like this from a wealthy charity like PETA could throw that system into even further chaos.Surely, if animals can sue humans, then shouldn t humans be able to sue animals? As you can see, when you pursue this activist rabbit hole, reality starts to dissolve rather quickly.More on this incredible story from AP Monkey Selfie    Copyright credited to David J.

24,"ROME (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi returned to frontline Italian politics at the weekend, staking his claim to lead a resurgent center-right into national elections that are expected early next year. At exactly the same moment, Berlusconi s outspoken ally, Matteo Salvini, was addressing his Northern League party and laying down his own marker to become the next prime minister.  Salvini Premier  read a sign stuck to the lectern. In reality, neither man looks likely to head the next government if they pull off an election victory, and possible alternative candidates are already emerging.  There is an apparent power struggle going on between Berlusconi and Salvini, but it will not get out of hand. They know a violent clash would be suicidal with voters,  said Piero Ignazi, politics professor at Bologna University.  The truth is both men will remain head of their respective parties, but they won t be the next prime minister,  he said. This would open the way for a consensus candidate who would have to bridge the huge divergences between the three main rightist parties   from the fierce anti-EU agenda put forward by both the Northern League and Brothers of Italy to the pro-European vision embraced by Berlusconi on Sunday. Latest opinion polls show this trio of long-standing allies are pulling ahead in the polls and predicted to win a combined 35 percent of the vote, with the anti-migrant Northern League just ahead of Berlusconi  Forza Italia on some 15 percent. By contrast, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) are seen on around 28 percent apiece. The 5-Star has ruled out any coalition alliances and the center-left pool of votes is shrinking as various leftist parties engage in ferocious infighting. Under the current electoral system no party or bloc looks like winning enough seats to govern alone. However, political analysts say the wind is filling the center-right s sails after years of adverse conditions, giving it pre-election momentum. Berlusconi ignominiously resigned from power in 2011 during a sovereign debt crisis. Mired in sex scandals and legal woes, he was subsequently expelled from the Senate and banned from running for office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction. Open heart surgery last year left most analysts writing his political obituary. But not for the first time, the media tycoon, now 81, bounced back and has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to overturn the ban on seeking election. A hearing is scheduled for November, but a verdict is unlikely to come for several months, meaning he almost certainly will not be able to stand in the next national ballot, which is due by May 2018 and widely expected to be held in March.  Despite his age, Berlusconi would love to be prime minister again. It would be his last hurrah. But realistically speaking, it is not about to happen,  said a Forza Italia official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Significantly, Berlusconi made his political comeback speech at an event organized by Forza Italia stalwart Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament. Party sources said Tajani was in pole position to be Berlusconi s surrogate. While Berlusconi s name abroad evokes memories of  bunga bunga  sex parties and wisecracks, Tajani is a much less colorful character, whose pro-European instincts would make him a reassuring figure for international markets. Those very same instincts would pose a problem for Berlusconi s hardline allies, who have regularly denounced the European Union and have called for Italy to quit the euro.  The leader of the center-right needs to be chosen through a clear process, perhaps a primary,  Giorgia Meloni, the head of Brothers of Italy, told Sky Italia television on Sunday.  I imagine that whatever grassroots method you decide, Tajani will not win out,  she said. Brothers of Italy is a small, nationalist party, which is anti-migrant and anti-euro. It tries to differentiate itself from the League by saying it focuses on the whole country, not just the wealthy north.      Buoyed by the League s strong poll numbers, Salvini says the leader of the party which wins the most votes next year should automatically be the prime ministerial candidate.  But Berlusconi, a four-times premier, has ruled out handing over the baton of power to Salvini, who has embraced Europe s far-right and endorsed France s National Front.  We created the center-right in Italy and we have always been its leader, laying out and fulfilling its program,  Berlusconi said on Sunday. The two men have not spoken for months, saying they are in no hurry to discuss strategy. Political analysts have speculated that the pro-business Forza Italia might find it easier to create a government of national unity with former prime minister Matteo Renzi s PD party rather than the populist Northern League. Forza Italia loyalists reject this notion.  We ruled with the Northern League for years in national government and we are ruling with them now in the regions and it is going well,  said Forza Italia lawmaker Deborah Bergamini. One such regional coalition is in Liguria, headed by Forza Italia s Giovanni Toti. He attended both the Forza Italia and Northern League rallies at the weekend and is due to take part in a Brothers of Italy meeting this weekend.  Toti has been carefully building bridges between the three parties and would be a natural choice to head any national coalition,  Bologna University s Ignazi said. ",1

26,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Geological Survey said on Saturday it could not conclusively confirm whether a magnitude 3.5 earthquake detected in North Korea was manmade or natural. USGS put the epicenter of the quake 22 km (14 miles) east-northeast of Sungjibaegam, North Korea, near the country s main nuclear test site. Chinese earthquake officials earlier said the tremor was a  suspected explosion , while South Korean officials and CTBTO, the nuclear proliferation watchdog, both said they believed it was a natural quake.  The depth is poorly constrained and has been held to 5 km by the seismologist,  USGS said.

Instead of using the opportunity to condemn the growing, violent movement, he actually appeared to be condoning it. While paying tribute to the fallen officers for sacrificing their lives to protect others from a sniper, Mr. Obama also called on law enforcement agencies to root out bigotry. We have all seen this bigotry in our lives at some point,  Mr. Obama told an audience of several hundred at a concert hall in Dallas. None of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments. We know this.  The officers   Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa were killed by a black sniper who told police he targeted white officers during a Black Lives Matter protest.The day after the memorial service for the Dallas cops who were murdered by a Black Lives Matter supporter, President Barack Obama invited BLM leaders to the White House for a private meeting:It should come as no surprise to anyone that the most recent assassination of an innocent cop was at the hands of Hillary Clinton supporter Alexander Bonds, given her outreach to the Black Lives Matter terror group during her campaign. Wikileaks even released an email showing how radical group Center For American Progress was advising her on how to fake empathy for parents of kids killed by cops. Wikileaks released an email from Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, coaching Hillary on how to best gain the trust of the Black community by going directly to the victims being held up by Black Lives Matter movement as heroes, and faking empathy with the parents. She also mentions it would be a good idea to use the idea that their grief should be magnified because it happened at the hands of law enforcement officers (the state).Given all that has happened over the last few days with the Black Lives Matter movement, I thought it would be a good idea for Hillary to pen an op ed, discussing the pain people feel as parents at the loss of their children to these incidents of police brutality, how as a parent, she knows that pain is magnified because it happens at the hands of the state, and her commitment to solve the problem as President.Given her strong words on Charlotte, it could serve as a reminder that she gets it that racism isn t like everything else. She wouldn t have to mention Bernie s name, but I think it could really respond to the sense of continual injured dignity .I think, but others will know better, that it will move around the social media networks. > > Anyway, just thought I d share with you guys . >> Thanks! > > Neera >While Barack Obama was in office, radical activist, hate-monger and racial division expert Al Sharpton was a regular visitor.

He said police in Oakland, Calif., were wrong to stop a child riding a bicycle.Authorities are trying to piece together a motive after NYPD officer and mother of three Miosotis Familia was brutally gunned down in cold blood by Alexander Bonds early Monday morning while she sat in a temporary headquarters vehicle at East 183rd Street and Morris Avenue in Fordham Heights.Bonds was subsequently killed by two other officers called to the scene while Familia died in hospital. This is absolutely an unprovoked attack,  said NYPD Commissioner James P. O Neill. Police say surveillance footage shows Bonds pulling up his hoodie before  purposefully  walking up to the vehicle and shooting through the passenger side. Speculation as to why 34-year-old Bonds, who had previously served seven years in prison for a Syracuse robbery, gunned down Familia has begun to center on his political beliefs.Bonds  Facebook page reveals that days before the presidential election, he posted a video of a woman alleging that voting machines were switching Hillary Clinton votes to Donald Trump.Watch video Bonds made below, where he tells his Facebook followers about his hate for cops. He calls police  faggots  and accuses them of raping children. He also says he s  up and ready  for the cops, using his time in jail as an example of how he got ready for them. He posted the words  Mad as hill  above the video.On the same day he urged people to  get mad  about the election and vote. When asked who he was voting for, Bonds responded that he couldn t vote (due to his felony conviction), but said people should vote for Hillary Clinton.Bonds also posted Malcolm X memes as well as videos of confrontations between black people and police officers. Previous ambush-style murders of police officers have been motivated by extremist anti-cop  Black Lives Matter -style rhetoric, as well as mass shootings of police officers like the Dallas massacre, which was celebrated by BLM sympathizers.

30,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas measures criticized as being discriminatory for limiting transgender people’s access to bathrooms in schools and public buildings died on Tuesday, as the House adjourned and ended its special legislative session. Business leaders and civil rights groups had battled to defeat the bills, saying they advanced bigotry, would tarnish the state’s image and damage its economy. The measures were blocked by moderate House Republicans.  Adoption by Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could have fed momentum in other socially conservative states on the issue, a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. “Finally, Texans can breathe a temporary sigh of relief,” said JoDee Winterhof, an official of the Human Rights Campaign that lobbied against the bills. “Texans don’t want harmful, anti-transgender legislation,” Winterhof, the campaign’s senior vice president for policy and political affairs, said in a statement. Momentum for so-called bathroom bills stalled this year when  North Carolina partially repealed a similar law in March. The original law prompted boycotts by athletic bodies and businesses that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Texas could have lost about $5.6 billion through 2026 if it had enacted such a measure, said the Texas Association of Business, the state’s leading employer grouping. The House wound up its duties without taking action on any of the bills and adjourned “sine die,” a day ahead of the official end of the 30-day special session. House Speaker Joe Straus, a pro-business Republican who controls the agenda in the chamber, said the issue was not a priority. Straus’ position was reinforced by a well-financed campaign by major corporations, including Texas-based energy companies Halliburton and ExxonMobil Global Services, which have said the bills would make it hard for them to recruit top talent. The measure that advanced the farthest was Senate Bill 3, which passed easily on a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and then died in the House. It would have required people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. Supporters, including Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a staunch social conservative, say the proposed curbs promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children. ",1

While the President himself will not be attending, Michelle Obama is expected to make an appearance   and Malia and Sasha Obama are even going to be bridesmaids! It s sure to be a beautiful wedding and everyone involved is sure to have fun   but of course conservatives have to sh*t all over everything beautiful.When TMZ reported the story, some of Trump s  deplorables  jumped right out of their basket to let the world know why Hillary Clinton was justified in calling them that to begin with.This fine person really wants the White House to be white again. Welfare Mammy    probably not a real name   thinks the Obama family are a  bunch of n-words. President Trump  (we re trying to figure out which candidate he supports) is just an outright racist. Max  agrees with Mr. President s primate theory. Freedom  is very passionate about this issue, even postulating that the Obamas are  all f*cking each other.   The rest are just deplorable.    The Right jumps on the Obama girls every chance they get   including when Malia graduated high school and again when she was accepted to Harvard, and when the girls hang out with their friends  they even wished rape on Sasha Obama when she turned 15 years old.All of these people will be voting in November. Make sure you are out there doing the same. The last thing we need is 4-8 years of normalizing this behavior.Featured image via Pinterest/screengrab",0
32,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday urged U.S. insurers offering coverage next year under his national healthcare law to step up their efforts to enroll those who remain uninsured, especially younger and healthier Americans. Several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have announced they will pull back from the Obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing financial losses due to the costs of covering members who are sicker than expected. Their planned exit has prompted new questions over whether Obamacare can survive over the long-term if insurers cannot create a viable business from the market. Insurance premiums for consumers have jumped each year since Obamacare plans took effect in 2014, and those price increases are expected to grow steeper as fewer insurers participate.  Obama, in a letter to all insurers selling health plans next year on the exchanges, noted that the program has helped reduce the percentage of Americans without health insurance to a record low, and acknowledged that it could still be improved to benefit insurers and consumers. His administration will help find and enroll those who still lack coverage, with a particular focus on enrolling young adults.  “Since the remaining uninsured are disproportionately younger and healthier, signing them up improves the risk pool and consequently the affordability of coverage for all enrollees,” Obama said in the letter.  Obama, Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and other top health advisers on Monday met with executives from several leading insurance companies, including Cigna Corp Chief Executive David Cordani and Humana CEO Bruce Broussard, to discuss ways to strengthen the marketplace ahead of its fourth open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1, according to a White House official.         A spokeswoman for industry group America’s Health Insurance Plans said the meeting’s focus included increasing enrollment.  “As health plans are preparing for open enrollment, today’s meeting was focused on how to build on the continued progress in reducing the uninsured rate and moving forward with policy solutions that will support a stable, affordable market for 2017 and beyond,” AHIP spokeswoman Clare Krusing said.

35,"In 1991, when old, white men turned on Anita Hill, a monster was awakened, and that monster was the fury of the woman. In the 1992 election, women let the old boy s club know exactly how it felt   they elected a Democrat for president, and they made unprecedented gains in the House and he Senate. The 1992 election was called the Year of the Woman. And it was all thanks to one woman   Hill   who stood up to the good old boys.And now that the 2016 Democratic Primary is almost over, with Hillary Clinton reaching the threshold to claim victory, women will come out of the woodwork (at an even faster pace) and enact real change.Vox contends that should Clinton win the presidency, just her mere presence in the White House will be enough to spur a growth of women running for office:Clinton s gender is the most obvious way she stands out from everyone who s held the presidency before, but people inside and outside the campaign have hesitated to argue explicitly that it matters. But it does matter. Enormously. A woman president would be   by far   the biggest, most salient, and most important example of a successful woman in American politics likely inspiring secondary and tertiary waves of women s election runs and election victories.Using analysis from political consultant Amelia Showalter, Vox shows that when women are even mentioned as potentially running for office, female involvement in the whole process increases by a percentage point. When a woman is elected as a state Attorney General, participation increases to two percent. When elected Governor, it increases to 2.36 percent. When elected Senator, it increases to 2.9 percent.Should Clinton be elected President of the United States, with the sort of name recognition she has, the amount of female participation in the process (elected and unelected) would increase astronomically. And that measure doesn t include the throngs of women Clinton will choose to fill her cabinet.Analysis also shows that when women have representation (such as the presidency) and their identity politics   abortion, equal pay, childcare   are adequately represented by women, they will cause a ripple effect that will essentially bring male legislators onto their side. As Tali Mendelberg, Christopher Karpowitz, and Nicholas Goedert show:When women are many, they are more likely to voice women s distinctive concerns about children, family, the poor and the needy. What s more, when women are more numerous and therefore more vocal on these topics, men become more vocal too, and these effects are associated with more generosity to the poor.Women, in a sense, could liberalize the country by being elected to office. How do they get elected to office? They are inspired to run. And how are they inspired to run? They see other women, like Hillary Clinton, achieve high office.It s a ripple effect that will usher in the much needed change in Washington. After all, it s been proven that women in Congress, when they are in charge, get more done in a more bipartisan fashion.Hillary Clinton is going to help continue that.Featured image via Kevin Winter",0
36,"As a Wellesley graduate, I was shocked and dismayed by Hillary Clinton s commencement address. Actually, that is #FakeNews. I was neither shocked nor dismayed by Mrs. Clinton s speech (but I did graduate from Wellesley   with honors!) It was exactly the kind of self-pitying, leaden and all-about-me performance that I would have expected from the entitled former Democrat candidate and now sore loser.Watch a few of Hillary s greatest hits during her commencement speech at Wellesley College:Also, it revealed this: Hillary hasn t learned a thing. As her friend Mike Bloomberg recently told an audience of Harvard Business School grads   Hillary lost the election because she had absolutely no message. She still doesn t.In addition, she is utterly lacking in self-awareness. She spoke at length about what she sees as a  full-fledged assault on truth and reason,  telling the graduating seniors that  the future of America, indeed the future of the world, depends on brave, thoughtful people like you insisting on truth and integrity right now every day.  This, from a woman who ran for our nation s highest office while distrusted by nearly two-thirds of the country, with good reason.As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.In her remarks, Hillary criticized  people    aka Trump followers, presumably   on social media for  sowing division at a time when we desperately need unity,  and then proceeded to give a highly partisan and divisive speech.Did she ever consider that there might be families in the audience who voted for her opponent? That they might not enjoy her taking veiled potshots at President Trump, and that this was their daughters  day too?Echoing the liberal media, Hillary went after President Trump through innuendo and clich s, talking about the dangers of fomenting fear and of  alternative facts.  Good thing there was no Q&A; someone might have wanted further clarification of how she came under sniper fire in Bosnia, or how a video caused the Benghazi attack or how the Monica Lewinsky scandal stemmed from a  vast right-wing conspiracy  and not Bill Clinton s unruly libido.Hillary trod dangerous pathways as she remarked,  when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.  She is correct, of course, but a cursory review of her multiple dodges and lies about her mishandling of classified information and efforts to destroy evidence reveals a woman who fully earned her low trustworthiness ratings from Americans.The election is over, but Hillary cannot let it go. This is good news for Republicans. As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton missed an opportunity at Wellesley. She could have delivered a message of unity, and helped our anxious country begin to heal. Her followers need to see her putting country above politics; they need to see her as she briefly appeared at the inauguration, supporting the peaceful and legitimate transfer of power. Apparently, that is just too heavy a lift for Mrs. Clinton. She is happier nursing her wounds, and continuing to inflict them on the country.The former First Lady could also have talked about the dramatic changes taking place in our economy, and how women are thriving as entrepreneurs. She could have talked about the founders of Rent the Runway, or Sarah Blakely, who created Spanx, or Essie Weingarten, who bet her life s savings on a new idea and created a nail polish empire sold to L Oreal in 2010. These women are inspirational; they didn t shatter glass ceilings, they ignored them. It is true we need women in politics, and running NGOs, but we also need women making money and boosting the economy. That s where the funding for free college tuition and refugee services comes from   a lesson Hillary may never have learned.The New York Times tells us that the students cheered Mrs. Clinton  thunderously.  Of course they did. They have been weaned on courses like  Love and Intimacy  in the Women s and Gender Studies department or  Changing Gender Constructions in the Modern Middle East  in the History Department. There s nothing wrong with those studies, unless they crowd out learning how the progressive policies of Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have failed in France, for instance, leading to a stagnant economy with few opportunities for progress. Or how capitalism has delivered billions from poverty, including in Communist China, where the growth miracle of recent decades was facilitated by policies that encouraged entrepreneurship and private enterprise.Hillary Clinton missed some history lessons too, apparently. She alluded to Nixon s presidency which  would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.  That isn t true, of course; Nixon resigned from office. It was her husband Bill who was impeached. Amazing she would get that wrong, in delivering what was sure to be a much-reviewed address. Maybe a little too much of that Chardonnay, Mrs. Clinton?

37,"If anyone were to tell you 20 years ago that a career criminal, habitual liar and an enabler of husband who is a serial sexual offender was going to be a frontrunner for President of The United States in two decades simply because of her genitalia, would you have believed them?While the State Department s own internal probe found former Secretary Hillary Clinton violated federal recordkeeping laws, it s not the first time she and her top aides shielded her e-mail from public disclosure while serving in a government position.As first lady, Hillary was embroiled in another scheme to bury sensitive White House e-mails, known internally as  Project X. In 1999, as investigators looked into Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and other scandals involving the then-first lady, it was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed e-mails were mysteriously  lost  due to a  glitch  in a West Wing computer server.The massive hole in White House archives covered a critical two-year period   1996 to 1998   when Republicans and special prosecutor Ken Starr were subpoenaing White House e-mails.Despite separate congressional investigations and a federal lawsuit over Project X, high-level e-mails dealing with several scandals were never turned over. And the full scope of Bill and Hillary Clintons  culpability in the parade of scandals was never known.To those well-versed in Clinton shenanigans, this all sounds distressingly familiar. Thanks to another server-related problem, Clinton so far has gotten away with withholding more than 30,000 e-mails from congressional committees investigating the Benghazi terrorism cover-up, Clinton Foundation foreign-influence peddling and other scandals. This Clinton e-mail scandal is nothing new,  Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told me.  There were previous efforts to hide e-mails in the Clinton White House. His Washington watchdog group filed a lawsuit to recover the missing White House e-mails back then, just as it has against the State Department now, though it has had better luck in this case.The parallels don t end there.During the Project X e-mail scandal, career White House staffers and contractors found that someone close to the first lady had basically turned off the White House s automated e-mail-archiving system. They fingered White House  special assistant  Laura Crabtree Callahan, who was overseeing the computer contractors despite obtaining computer-science degrees from diploma mills.Read more: NYP",0
38,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh/YANGON (Reuters) - Two blasts rocked an area on the Myanmar side of the border with Bangladesh on Monday, accompanied by the sound of gunfire and thick black smoke, as violence that has sent nearly 90,000 Muslim Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh showed no sign of easing. Bangladeshi border guards said a woman lost a leg from a blast about 50 meters inside Myanmar and was carried into Bangladesh to get treatment. Reuters reporters heard explosions and saw black smoke rising near a Myanmar village. The latest violence in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to Bangladesh. A Rohingya refugee who went to the site of the blast - on a footpath near where civilians fleeing violence are huddled in no man s land on the border - filmed what appeared to be a mine: a metal disc about 10 centimeters (3.94 inches) in diameter partially buried in the mud. He said he believed there were two more such devices buried in the ground. Bangladeshi border guards said they believed the injured woman stepped on an anti-personnel mine, although that was not confirmed. Two refugees also told Reuters they saw members of the Myanmar army around the site in the immediate period preceding the blasts which occurred around 2:25 p.m.  Reuters was unable to independently verify that the planted devices were landmines and that there was any link to the Myanmar army. The spokesman for Myanmar s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Zaw Htay, said that a clarification was needed to determine  where did it explode, who can go there and who laid those land mines. Who can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists?   There are so many questions. I would like to say that it is not solid news-writing if you write based on someone talking nonsense on the side of the road,  said Zaw Htay. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has come under increasing diplomatic pressure from countries with large Muslim populations such as Turkey and Pakistan to protect Rohingya civilians. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October. On Monday, Reuters reporters saw fires and heard gunshots before the explosions near the Myanmar village of Taung Pyo Let Way.  Myanmar officials blamed Rohingya militants for the burning of homes and civilian deaths but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is trying to force Rohingya out with a campaign of arson and killings. The number of those crossing the border into Bangladesh - 87,000 - surpassed the number who escaped Myanmar after a series of much smaller insurgent attacks last October that set off a military operation. That operation has led to accusations of serious human rights abuses. The newest estimate, based on calculations by U.N. workers in the Bangladeshi border district of Cox s Bazar, takes to about 174,000 the total number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October. The new arrivals have strained aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar.  We are trying to build houses here, but there isn t enough space,  said Mohammed Hussein, 25, who was still looking for a place to stay after fleeing Myanmar four days ago.  No non-government organizations came here. We have no food. Some women gave birth on the roadside. Sick children have no treatment.   Hundreds of Rohingya milled beside the road while others slung tarpaulins over bamboo frames to make shelters against the monsoon rain. Among new arrivals, about 16,000 are school-age children and more than 5,000 are under the age of five who need vaccine coverage, aid workers said over the weekend.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who said on Friday that violence against Myanmar s Muslims amounted to genocide, last week called Bangladesh s President Abdul Hamid to offer help in sheltering the Rohingya, Dhaka said. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Suu Kyi and other officials in Myanmar on Monday, to urge a halt to the violence. Suu Kyi s office said Marsudi expressed the Indonesian government s  support of the activities of the Myanmar government for the stability, peace and development of Rakhine state . They also discussed humanitarian aid and the two countries would collaborate for the development of the state, Suu Kyi s office said without giving further details.   There were more anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta on Monday.  Malala Yousafzai, the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, called on Suu Kyi to condemn the  shameful  treatment of the Rohingya, saying  the world is waiting  for her to speak out. In addition to tens of thousands of Rohingya, more than 11,700  ethnic residents  had been evacuated from northern Rakhine state, the Myanmar government has said, referring to non-Muslims. The army said on Sunday Rohingya insurgents had set fire to monasteries, images of Buddha as well as schools and houses in the north of Rakhine state. It posted images of destroyed Buddha statues.

39,"A Massachusetts crime lab scandal could result in tens of thousands of criminal convictions being overturned. It s not the first time this has happened in the state either.As Addicting Info reported in May of last year, up to 60,000 drug cases were impacted by a scandal that rocked the Hinton Drug Lab, located in Boston, MA.In that case, a chemist by the name of Annie Dookhan plead guilty to 27 criminal charges, including  tampering with evidence, violating the state witness intimidation statute, multiple counts of lying to a grand jury, falsely claiming to carry a degree and others. Over a 14 year period, Dookhan forged documents, testified falsely in criminal cases and tampered with test results while employed as a chemist at the state crime lab.After Dookhan s confession thousands of convictions were overturned and hundreds of cases, which were still pending, were dismissed.The state of MA conducted a 15-month-long investigation into the crime lab, finding  a pattern of neglect, mismanagement, and poor standards. In spite of the state s findings, no other employees faced criminal charges. The Hinton lab was eventually closed down.Now another MA drug lab is facing a massive backlash, after court documents revealed a separate scandal involving drug use, evidence tampering and a series of other crimes earlier this week.As the Boston Herald reports, Amherst state lab chemist Sonja Farak was convicted in 2014 of tampering with evidence, theft and drug use inside the crime lab, where she was employed for more than eight years.At the height of her criminal activity, Farak was smoking crack ten to twelve times a day inside the crime lab, as well as using a host of other drugs which she obtained through the lab.Farak confessed to using the drugs at her work station, where she also tested samples submitted by law enforcement.She also confessed to being high while giving testimony in criminal cases and during interviews with police.While she was convicted of multiple crimes in 2014, officials did not disclose important details about how Farak s criminal activities had likely compromised tens of thousands of cases that she worked on.It took an order from the state Supreme Court to finally bring the extent of her misconduct to light.The ACLU released a statement on the Farak case, saying: The magnitude of the Amherst Lab misconduct rivals the similar scandal at the Hinton Lab, involving disgraced chemist Annie Dookhan, and the twin Massachusetts scandals have no known parallel elsewhere in the country. Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, went on to state: There is only one sensible response to these revelations: promptly notify the people who were denied due process, undo their wrongful convictions, and rethink the unjust war on drugs. The Boston Herald reports that Farak may have tainted the results in as many as 40,000 cases during the eight years she worked as a state crime lab chemist.Combined, the Dookhan and Farak scandals in MA alone could easily have caused more than 100,000 innocent people to be wrongfully imprisoned.If rampant corruption in just two state crime labs can result in the destruction of so many lives, we have to ask ourselves what is the impact when combined with corrupt law enforcement, corrupt courts and a corrupt penal system that thrives on profit?As the ACLU states here, fighting the failed war on drugs has only served to undermine the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.It s time to end the failed drug war, once and for all.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons",0
40,"As Politico reports an almost neck-and-neck race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Los Angeles Times has endorsed the former Secretary of State before the critical primary on June 7.The editorial board laid out plainly their support for Clinton, highlighting her ability to get the job done in the face of rising populism:As all the world knows, Clinton would be the first woman elected president of the United States. That would be a joyous, long-awaited, landmark moment in American history after centuries of discrimination and second-class status for half the population. But the real reason to support her is that she is the Democratic candidate most likely to get the job done.As the mainstream media is peddling a completely false narrative that Clinton s support is unexcited or unenthusiastic, the Los Angeles Times destroys that now hackneyed talking point:[C]linton s candidacy might seem unexciting. But nominating a candidate for president is, or ought to be, serious business. As Obama himself likely would admit after almost eight years in the White House, there is more to being president than grand promises, whether they are about  hope and change  or a political revolution. We admire Bernie Sanders  passion for progress and equality, but our endorsement goes to the candidate who is more likely to translate ideals into action.Sanders and Clinton have been fighting hard to win over the California electorate, which offers up just under 550 delegates. Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 97 percent chance of winning the state, but Sanders has shown to be as competitive as ever.The Times pointed out that Sanders  popular rhetoric amongst younger voters have made him a very formidable candidate who should be taken seriously, not brushed aside even heading into the convention (assuming Clinton clinches the magic number of delegates to win). Saying that he has made the race more substantive and he has drawn Clinton to he left, the board seriously doubted his ability to bring Republicans to the table.But that s not to say he couldn t.On the last day of registration, over 150,000 new citizens were admitted on the rolls, 42 percent of which were between the ages of 18 and 34, a good sign for Senator Sanders. Sanders also has outspent Clinton in critical metropolitan areas all across the state, including Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego and so forth.As the primary winds down, California will be the seemingly final hurrah in a long battle between the two progressive candidates, with one victor walking away as the nominee for president come July.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0
41," Snitches get stitches  is Kremlin s message to the United States   at least according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, anyway. Discussing Rex Tillerson s planned visit to Russia, Zakharova complained about the leaks coming out of the Trump administration:First, the US Department of State asked us to keep the planned visit quiet and not to announce it until the last possible minute, until we coordinated the date. We did as they asked. But a day or two later the information was leaked by the US State Department and sometimes by the US administration. Frankly, this put Russia and the media in a strange situation, because they didn t know who to believe   the official agencies or the many leaks.If the Trump administration continues leaking like a colander, she says, there will be consequences:Also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington in the past few years, continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama s terms in office. Believe me, this could be very interesting information.Recently, Trump has been in a panic trying to contain leaks   particularly about his and his administration s relationship with Russia.At this point, it is fair to ask: what do they have on him and other Republicans? Is this threat to release Obama-era information a veiled warning to The Donald to plug the holes through which facts are slipping?Featured image via Getty Images (Mikhail Svetlov/Pool)",0
42,"The battle between supporters of Black Lives Matter and those who see BLM as a racist, violent group of domestic terrorists is getting worse in the wake of the deaths of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, which BLM had zilch to do with. It s easy to assume that every police department everywhere are working on ways to stop BLM in their tracks, but that s not true. There is at least one department that actually sees BLM quite differently.Earlier this week, Phoenix Black Lives Matter hosted a forum in which police officers, and other community leaders, were invited to speak. The Phoenix Police Department s assistant chief, Mike Kurtenbach, said outright: The Phoenix Police Department doesn t see Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization. We view Black Lives Matter as a partner who holds us accountable.We stand with you to find solutions. There s no way to respond to that but with cheers, and Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton reinforced that by telling the diverse crowd that they re looking to have a very diverse police department, and they want people to apply to work in their department. More diversity can mean more accountability, which means changing policing for the better. Working with BLM as a partner, instead of fighting them as a terrorist group, also leads to better policing.We re full of people mostly conservative who believe that BLM is specifically waging a war against cops, though BLM actually decries that violence. They want to remain peaceful. Yet, our conservative leaders, particularly those at the Republican National Convention right now, scream about Black Lives Matter being inherently racist, as Donald Trump himself said. Then again, from a white supremacist, that s not too surprising, but it s disgusting that so many in the GOP agree with him.There s also Rudy Guiliani, who claims to have saved a lot more lives with his broken windows policy than Black Lives Matter ever did. He said: I don t see what Black Lives Matter is doing for blacks other than isolating them. All it cares about is the police shooting of blacks. It doesn t care about the 90 percent of blacks that are killed by other blacks. We don t see how he cares about black lives at all. New York City s broken windows policing model has led to a very, very racist department that targets members of the black community for really stupid stuff far more than white people.Then there are some police departments that see BLM as a threat, and any support of them as a gross insult, almost along the lines of people spitting on soldiers returning from a war they disagree with. For instance, the Somerville, Mass. department is calling for the removal of a Black Lives Matter banner from City Hall like it s the Confederate flag. Their union actually said: The Somerville Police Employees Association and its members are deeply troubled that the city continues to display the Black Lives Matter banner above the main entrance of City Hall. It is inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our city would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country. The people who cry,  All lives matter,  really don t get why the movement specifies the black community. Some lives in this country matter more than others here. Given the rate at which unarmed black people are shot by police, are arrested and incarcerated by our justice system, and how they re perceived as guilty until proven innocent, their lives matter considerably less than other lives.That is an undisputable fact.So it s very refreshing to see a police department that s willing to work with BLM on improving policing by seeing them as a partner in this, rather than as a hostile movement that incites terrorism and insults police officers by its very existence. We need a lot more of this.Featured image via Phoenix Police Department",0
43,"It can easily be said that Donald Trump doesn t have a clue what he is doing. He hears things in clips and talking points, and then spews them out to the world, usually via Twitter, without thinking about the weight of his actions.One of the things Trump has been hung up on lately is Canada taking control of their dairy. According to Business Insider: Last year, Canada implemented a policy that created a new class of milk prices for ultra-filtered milk, a liquid, high-protein concentrate sometimes used to make products such as cheese and yogurt. Canada lowered the prices for this milk class, so as to incentivize domestic ultra-filtered milk and better compete with the US-produced imports. How dare they, right? The United States should not only legislate in their own country regarding the market but also around the world. At least that s what Trump seems to think.So Trump, trying to puff his chest and seem like he s a tough guy, tweets out: Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult.

Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2017, as National Day of Patriotic Devotion, in order to strengthen our bonds to each other and to our country   and to renew the duties of government to the people.While millions of women march for equality, the White House Press Secretary lies to the American people, and the unavoidable conflicts of interests and Russian secrets sow doubt in American minds, Trump decides to make his  special day  a national holiday  for the people. This is what American politics has come to.I m young enough to remember when Republicans thought President Obama was arrogant and narcissistic for putting arugula on his hamburger.But Trump wants to proclaim a day all for himself and his glory (after losing the popular vote by 3 million)? Not a peep from the right.Imagine the outcry from the Republicans and Fox News if President Obama had even referred to his inauguration day as such   to say nothing of what they d do if he d ordered it.Remembering that Trump did indeed lose the popular vote by 3 million, it would seem inappropriate to declare his inauguration a national day of  devotion. No one devoted themselves to Trump. No one devoted themselves to Mike Pence. And no one devoted themselves to the government. Want to know why? The government devotes itself to the people, not vice versa.Trump has turned the office of the presidency into a spectacle showboat of admiration for himself. Woe to all the pundits and those in the media who promised and hoped for a pivot. And an even bigger woe to all those who voted for him thinking the same thing.Move over Kim Jong-Un, there s a new  Dear Leader  amongst us.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",0
45,"The swamp is draining One more RINO is not running for reelection. Senator Jeff Flake announced he will not run again today in a vindictive speech against President Trump and Republicans. Hey, the guy was even thinking of running as an Independent what does that tell you? He s NOT a conservative! He mentioned in his speech that he couldn t support Trump s policies on trade and immigration. Well, those two policies are what got Trump elected!FLAKE WAS 26 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS:The bombshell, which Flake, R-Ariz., detailed Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor, will further roil Republican hopes of keeping the party s 52-seat Senate majority in the midterm elections of Trump s first term, when the president s party historically loses seats in Congress.It also likely will upend the race for Flake s seat.Flake, one of the Senate s more prominent critics of President Donald Trump, has been struggling in the polls.A GRANDSTANDING AND VINDICTIVE SPEECH:He told The Arizona Republic ahead of his announcement that he has become convinced  there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party. Flake said he has not  soured on the Senate  and loves the institution, but that as a traditional, libertarian-leaning conservative Republican he is out of step with today s Trump-dominated GOP. This spell will pass, but not by next year,  Flake said.Among Republican primary voters, there s overwhelming support for Trump s positions and  behavior,  Flake said, and one of their top concerns is whether a candidate is with the president or against him. While Flake said he is with Trump on some issues, on other issues he is not. And Trump definitely views him as a foe, having denounced Flake publicly and called him  toxic  on Twitter. Here s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I m not willing to take, and that I can t in good conscience take,  Flake told The Republic in a telephone interview.  It would require me to believe in positions I don t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone. LAURA INGRAHAM COULDN T HAVE SAID IT BETTER:Flake was for the disastrous Trans Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, open immig, blanket amnesty and had Hillary won, he'd be happy today.  Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 24, 2017As of Sept. 30, Flake s campaign had $3.4 million on hand. He has continued to raise money   as recently as Thursday, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice headlined a fundraiser for him in Arizona.Flake said he has ruled out running as an independent rather than a Republican, saying he didn t think that was a viable strategy. He also said he has  no intention  of making a presidential run.SENATE RACE HEATS UP:Kelli Ward, the former state senator from Lake Havasu City who lost her primary challenge last year against Sen. John McCain, has emerged this year as the top GOP alternative to Flake, but other names have been mentioned as possibilities: Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham and Arizona Board of Regents member Jay Heiler. Lesser-known Republicans Craig Brittain and Nicholas Tutora also have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are running.But Flake s exit is sure to prompt bigger Arizona Republican names to take a fresh look at the GOP Senate race.Steve Bannon, Trump s controversial former White House strategist, has embraced Ward as part of his national  open revolt  against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the GOP establishment. But other Republicans have warned that Ward is a weak candidate whose nomination would jeopardize GOP chances of holding Arizona s Senate seat.The winner of the Aug. 28 Republican primary could face Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., considered the front-runner in her the Democratic Senate primary.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised Flake as  one of the finest human beings I ve met in politicsFlake publicly announced his intentions in a Senate floor speech that began around noon Arizona time.In a copy of prepared remarks released to The Republic before his speech, Flake gave a blistering critique of the  coarseness of our national dialogue  that has defined the Trump era, saying it should never become accommodated as a  the new normal.

47,"After the Orlando Massacre we ve once again seen Republicans   led by Donald Trump   blame all Muslims for the action of one person or group of people. They insist, while not citing any actual evidence, that Muslims in America are not helping law enforcement to prevent terrorists in their midst, who are operating in their communities.It isn t true, and now someone is speaking out. Mohammed A. Malik actually flagged Orlando shooter Omar Mateen to the FBI, and after hearing Trump slander him and fellow Muslims, he s had enough.In an essay for the Washington Post, Malik told his story first hand:Donald Trump believes American Muslims are hiding something.  They know what s going on. They know that [Omar Mateen] was bad,  he said after the Orlando massacre.  They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.   But you know what? They didn t turn them in. And you know what? We had death and destruction. This is a common idea in the United States. It s also a lie. First, Muslims like me can t see into the hearts of other worshipers. (Do you know the hidden depths of everyone in your community?) Second, Trump is wrong that we don t speak up when we re able.Malik goes on to explain that after learning that Mateen had been watching videos put out by terrorist propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki,  I contacted the FBI again to let them know that Omar had been watching Awlaki s tapes. He hadn t committed any acts of violence and wasn t planning any, as far as I knew. And I thought he probably wouldn t, because he didn t fit the profile: He already had a second wife and a son. But it was something agents should keep their eyes on. Why did he do this?I had told the FBI about Omar because my community, and Muslims generally, have nothing to hide. I love this country, like most Muslims that I know. I don t agree with every government policy (I think there s too much money in politics, for instance), but I m proud to be an American.He concludes with a direct message for the Republican nominee for President of the United States:  Trump s assertions about our community   that we have the ability to help our country but have simply declined to do so   are tragic, ugly and wrong.

48,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump greeted Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Monday with a genteel handshake and nod, but no bow, avoiding the pitfall of U.S. President Barack Obama who was criticized at home for his deep bow to the monarch. Trump, wearing a suit and tie and his wife, Melania, in a long, dark blue dress, were met at the palace entrance by the royal couple, who were both wearing suits. Trump smiled, shook hands and nodded at the 83-year-old emperor before greeting Michiko as well. The four entered the palace where they chatted through interpreters in footage aired live on television, but without sound as is customary. After the meeting, Trump shook hands again, and tapped the emperor s arm repeatedly with his left hand.  Thank you for the great meeting , he told Akihito.  I m sure we will meet again . Obama came under fire after meeting the emperor in Tokyo in 2009 for what his critics back home said was bowing too low to Akihito. Some U.S. commentators said the U.S. president should not lower his head before foreign monarchs. Akihito has spent much of his reign working to heal the wounds of World War II, which was waged across Asia in his father s name, Emperor Hirohito. Obama also faced criticism from a different quarter - etiquette experts - who noted he combined a bow with an handshake, which is not done in Japan traditionally, whether meeting the emperor or anyone else. Japanese guests are not supposed to touch the royal couple or shake hands, but foreign guests often do. Hillary Clinton shook hands and air-kissed the empress on both cheeks, then took her hand as they entered the palace when she met the royal pair as secretary of state in 2011, a month or so after the triple disasters of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown hit northeastern Japan in March of that year. Traditionalists say that Japan s Chrysanthemum throne dates back more than 2,000 years. Akihito was the first royal heir in the Japanese imperial family to marry a commoner   a symbol of Japan s new modernity and confidence. Japan earlier this year enacted a law clearing the way for Akihito, to step down, clearing the way for the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in nearly two centuries and the accession of his son, Crown Prince Naruhito in late 2018 early 2019. Akihito s father, Emperor Hirohito, was considered divine until after Japan s defeat in World War Two. The current emperor is defined by the constitution as a symbol of the people, and has no political authority although he is widely respected. ",1
49,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s search for a new FBI director hit roadblocks on Tuesday when two high-profile potential candidates, a moderate judge and a conservative senator, signaled they did not want the job. Advisers to Judge Merrick Garland and U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas told Reuters they discouraged them from leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cautioning that they would be leaving important, secure jobs for one fraught with politics and controversy.  The advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the new FBI director would have little job security and heightened scrutiny by political observers following President Donald Trump’s abrupt firing of James Comey on May 9.  Garland and Cornyn distancing themselves from the selection process just three days before Trump has said he may make a decision, points to the difficulties the White House has in filling the FBI post amid turmoil in the administration.     Trump’s firing of Comey, the man in charge of an investigation into possible collusion between 2016 election campaign associates and the Russian government, outraged many lawmakers, including some Republicans. Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, “loves his job and is not interested in leaving the judiciary,” said one source familiar with the judge’s thinking. Cornyn said in a statement that he had informed the White House that “the best way I can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the U.S. Senate.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday that an announcement on FBI director was still possible before  Trump leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. He said the U.S. Department of Justice was still interviewing candidates. Several Republican senators had promoted Garland even though they had refused to give him a hearing when Republican Trump’s predecessor President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland last year for a then-vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Republicans’ reasoning appeared to be that Garland would be accepted by Democrats and help restore faith in the FBI as a nonpartisan agency. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell referred to Garland, a former federal prosecutor, as “an apolitical professional.” A second Garland acquaintance who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Garland sought advice from those who told him he would be leaving his life-long position on the federal bench to take a job that could be terminated by Trump overnight. A Republican Senate aide said Cornyn’s staff also worried that the third-term Texas Senator could cut his- and their own- careers short by going to the FBI.  An adviser to another candidate on the White House short-list, former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, 75, said Kelly is also being persuaded to step out of the running.  Kelly has not said that he would not consider the job, but so far he has not been interviewed. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor whose name had been floated, said on Monday he was not interested in the director position.  The difficulty in filling key administration jobs is not just limited to the FBI director post. Trump’s habits of contradicting his top aides, demanding personal loyalty and punishing officials who contradict him in public has discouraged a number of experienced people from pursuing jobs, said three people who declined to discuss possible positions with administration officials. “It’s becoming increasingly difficult to attract good people to work in this administration,” said one senior official. “In other cases, veteran people with expertise are leaving or seeking posts overseas and away from this White House.” ",1
50,"Before we explore the actual details of Marco Rubio s  extravagant purchase,  let s take a look at the brilliant tweet by Bill Sanderson, pointing out the hypocrisy of the left by comparing Marco Rubio s family home to Hillary s:https://twitter.com/mrgeology/status/608344761758568448After doing a deep dive on the Rubio s traffic violation history last week (just kidding, it wasn t a deep dive but instead information handed over by the far left American Bridge), the New York Times is back for more publishing of American Bridge material. This time, the NYT is letting everyone know just how broke the Rubio s were when they were young(er), just like everyone else in America. Oh, and that he s had trouble with his finances like every other person in America. And, he likes fun toys like any good man in America.For years, Senator Marco Rubio struggled under the weight of student debt, mortgages and an extra loan against the value of his home totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. But in 2012, financial salvation seemed to have arrived: A publisher paid him $800,000 to write a book about growing up as the son of Cuban immigrants.In speeches, Mr. Rubio, a Florida Republican, spoke of his prudent plan for using the cash to finally pay off his law school loans, expressing relief that he no longer owed  a lady named Sallie Mae,  as he once called the lender. Oh, and guess what guys? Marco Rubio had the nerve to buy a speed boat in Florida. How irresponsible. UPDATE: It was a fishing boat for his family, not an  extravagant   luxury speedboat  as the NYT claims.But at the same time, he splurged on an extravagant purchase: $80,000 for a luxury speedboat, state records show. At the time, Mr. Rubio confided to a friend that it was a potentially inadvisable outlay that he could not resist. The 24-foot boat, he said, fulfilled a dream.Here s a photo of the boat, and no, that isn t Rubio driving the boat.This is so ridiculous I m actually laughing at my computer right now. Rubio had student loan debt? Yeah, so? A lot of people do. The Rubios had trouble balancing their spending? Who doesn t? Rubio took out a loan on his home to make ends meet? Good for him, lots of people do. He was paid a hefty amount of money to write a book about his upbringing that he used to pay off debt? Even better. He had more than one home now? Cool, wish I did too. He spent $80,000 on a speed fishing boat in ocean surrounded Florida after paying off his debt? How could he?!Marco Rubio and his family are normal people chasing the American Dream and that scares the hell out of  dead broke so we could pay mortgages  Hillary Clinton supporters. The different between Rubio and Clinton is that Rubio embraces success and policies that allow every American to own multiple homes and a speed boat someday. Clinton, however, relishes in wealth instead of encouraging Americans to become wealthy themselves to live the good life. According to Clinton, not everyone can be queen.Via: Townhall",0
51,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian hacker arrested in Spain on a U.S. warrant said on Thursday he previously worked for President Vladimir Putin s United Russia party and feared he would be tortured and killed if extradited, RIA news agency reported. Peter Levashov was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona in April. U.S. prosecutors later charged him with hacking offences, accusing him of operating a network of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals. Levashov s comments offered a rare glimpse into the relationship between cyber criminals and the Russian state. U.S. officials say Russian authorities routinely shield hackers from prosecution abroad before recruiting them for espionage work. Russian hackers have been under intense scrutiny since U.S. intelligence officials accused Moscow of interfering in last year s U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.   U.S. prosecutors are seeking a 52-year jail sentence and Levashov, who denies the charges against him, is fighting his extradition from Spain. He told a court in Madrid on Thursday that he had worked for the United Russia party for the last 10 years.  I collected different information about opposition parties and delivered it to the necessary people at the necessary time,  RIA quoted him as saying. Levashov provided no further details about his work for the party, RIA reported, though said he was an officer in the Russian army with access to classified information.  It was unclear if Levashov was a serving officer or an army reservist having completed mandatory military service.  He also told the court investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges against him.  If I go to the U.S., I will die in a year. They want to get information of a military nature and about the United Russia party,  RIA quoted him as saying.  I will be tortured, within a year I will be killed, or I will kill myself.  Levashov has long been seen by cyber security investigators to be the person behind an online persona known as Peter Severa. Severa spent years listed among the world s 10 most prolific spammers, according to spam-tracking group Spamhaus. U.S. prosecutors have accused Levashov of running the infamous Kelihos botnet, a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses, ransomware, phishing emails and other spam attacks. Russia lodged its own request for Levashov s extradition last week, RIA reported. ",1

54,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire Hillary Clinton is the architect of US foreign policy failures in Libya and Syria.   We ve heard that statement many times over the course of this US election cycle, but exactly how much truth is there to it? After researching this issue, one quickly learns that it s not only true, it s an understatement. She wasn t just an architect, she was a chief instigator. Clinton s main source of resume credibility is her tenure as US Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013. During that time, Clinton resided over the planning and conception of two devastating conflicts, Libya and Syria. These two disasters will ultimately define both the Obama and Clinton legacies, and not for the reasons one might think. I would like to stress that the case being made here is not a political one, it is a moral and ethical inquiry into the actions and conduct of a public official.Before we get into Libya, which itself is a detailed and grave tale of nation building gone wrong, let s look closely at Syria   a conflict (not a Civil War) which has been dominating the international conversation for the last 4 years, but even more intensely in the last 18 months. Thus far, the results of US policy are abominable.What ownership does Clinton have over today s Syria? Today, the conflict is still being fuelled by tens of thousands of US and Gulf-backed militants, mostly of foreign origin, who comprise multiple Takfiri terrorist groups which the US insist calling  rebels.  This conclave includes the Islamic State (ISIS/Daesh), Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria), Arar al Sham, Nour al-din al-Zenki, Jaish al-Fatah (The Army of Conquest), along with many others. These armed groups are occupying strategic civilian areas throughout Syria, and it is a statement of fact that these terrorists are using civilian populations as human shields.A US-led  Coalition  is currently flying over Syria and Iraq, supposedly  fighting ISIS,  but is also coming dangerously close to conflict with both the Syrian and Russian militaries.Although this situation is now way beyond the pale, there was a time back in 2012 when a genuine diplomatic intervention could have helped to alter a fatal course of events.Hillary Clinton played a crucial role in initiating the current disaster.During a presidential primary debate in Milwaukee in February 2016, Clinton was quick to boast about her many  achievements  as Secretary of State, especially in Syria: You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolu
