Hi EveryBody!!

The objective of this project is the elaboration of a code that compiles four ML techniques for the detection of fake news.

A small DataSet is provided, with this you can replicate the experiment, it is in your hands to make it much bigger.
The exercise consists of two parts, the first is the cleaning and debugging of the database (.../Code/clean.ipynb). the second (.../Code/ToTrain.ipynb) is the training of the Code, the ML algorithms used are:

  1. Linear Regression
  2. Decision Trees
  3. Random Forests
  4. Gradient Boosting

To test the results we will have to take a one news from an official portal (cnn, new york times, Fox News, reuters...), copy all News and insert it in the final part, the program will analyze the entrie and it give you a result. the algorithms are optimized to find false news in the political and economic sphere, so it is not worth putting whatever type of news, in addition to that, the code is focused on false news in EEUU.

Enyoy :)
